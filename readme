If you have ever sent a password to someone in an email, we can bet they didn't delete it after reading it.

Think of TimeBomb as a URL shortener for confidential login exchange. Now you can send a client or a friend secret information on a time limit, making any would-be hackers work against the clock.

TimeBomb reminds everyone to use strong password management, and to not rely on an email account to store confidential information.

We delete expired links every hour, never use the same link twice, and our servers are behind bullet proof glass and armed guards (no joke).

Remember, we blow your passwords up so hackers can't find them.
